= DataQ

DataQ is a simple utility to read/write fields into a hierarchical data model built on top of a concatenation of structs.
Indeed, DataQ allows to reference a struct's field using hierarchical fully qualified name.

For instance, given the following concatenation of structs:

[source,golang]
----
type Level2 struct {
	Ypsilon int
	Omega   string
}

type Level1 struct {
	Alfa  float64
	beta  string
	Gamma *Level2
}
----

The fully qualified name of the field **Ypsilone** is **Gamma.Ypsilon**.

== Why DataQ

DataQ can be useful when struct's fields must be dyamically addressed.
